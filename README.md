Event Handling in React

Concept: 
This React app demonstrates how to handle different types of user events using Reactâ€™s built-in event system.

Features Implemented:

1. Button Click Event:**  
   A button displays "Clicked!" temporarily when clicked, showing dynamic state changes on interaction.

2. Input Change Event: 
   A text input updates state in real-time as the user types, demonstrating how to handle form input changes.

3. Form Submission Event:  
   When the form is submitted, the current value of the input is displayed in an alert, and the input is cleared. The `preventDefault()` method is used to prevent page reload.

4. Mouse Hover Event:  
   A box logs a message to the console when hovered over, demonstrating how to capture mouse events.

Purpose: 
To showcase practical usage of event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`, `onMouseEnter`) in a React component.

Technologies Used:
- React (Functional Components)
- useState Hook
- JavaScript ES6+
